# TasteBite Restaurant Website

This project is a modern, responsive one-page restaurant website designed to demonstrate clean semantic HTML, mobile-first CSS architecture, and interactive features built with vanilla JavaScript.

The website includes a responsive navigation menu with animations, smooth scrolling between sections, a table reservation call-to-action, accessibility-friendly markup, and a credits section for image attribution and developer information.

Built with best practices in frontend development, it features reusable CSS variables, hover and focus states, responsive layouts, and performance-friendly UI interactions — all without relying on external frameworks.
